<P><center><b><U><h1 style="font-family:Arial bounded MT bold">KIBAALE COMMUNITY PRIMARY SCHOOL ALUMNI</h></b></u></center></P>

<h3><b><center>DESCRIPTION</center></b></h3>
<p><center>KCPSA is an abbreviation for Kibaale Community Primary School Alumni which is an association of the old boys and girls of Kibaale Community Nursery and Primary School located in Kibaale Town Council, Namutumba district;This body is made up of different old learners of this institution  who are currently dispersed in different higher institutions of learning, working places and many other aspects of life. We are headed by many coordinators who in association with all the Obs and Ogs mobilise and coordinate various projects, we haven't established a basing place but the responsibilities have been distributed amongst different individuals and sometimes in junction with our patron based at school.</center></p>

<h4><b><center>BACKGROUND.</center></b></h4>
<p><center>In the month of December 2023,We came up with the idea of forming a whatsApp group called Kibaale Community Primary School Alumni. As more old boys and girls where being added into the group, they suggested that we elevate the WhatsApp group into an associaton and on 1st January 2024, KCPSA was formed made up of about 30 pioneer members. The group has continously expanded including even wellwishers who associate with us. Primary Seven Leavers of every academic year are automatically part of this association immediately after their last PLE paper unless otherwise stated by the school or particular individual or the person is a public nuisance.</center></p>
<h5><b><center><u>GOALS AND OBJECTIVES</u></center></b></h5>
<p><center><b>As people who have ever passed through this institution, we would wish to associate with this school because it's our family, we would wish to extend some services in our capacity to the school through the following ways.</b></center></p>
<p><center>First of all, we hope to foster unity among the different Alumni who have been through the school system at different times, to increase our interaction, sharing of ideas and form a strong dispersed network all over the world.</center></p>
<p><center>To form a common link with the school as an organized society, to air out our ideas on some issues when called upon and make it easier to locate and identify ourselves as Alumni of Kibaale Community Nursery and Primary School. </center></p>
<p><center>To provide scholastic materials such as books, pens, pencils, sanitary pads, sets, rulers to the less previlged learners so as to boast their academics because we understand what it means to lack such essential academic items and how it impacts on performance of the learner.</center></p>
 <p><center>Through co-curricular activities such as football, netball, volleyball and athletics competitions, we hope to promote talents of both the learners and the Alumni and also foster unity at such moments. We hope to schedule these events to occur always at a specified Sports Day after a given time interval. </center></p>
 <p><center>Since Agriculture is the back bone in our society, we hope to establish projects such as poultry keeping, passion fruit growing, goat keeping and so on.
